Explored how convolutional neural networks work. Created a baseline simple sequential network with no convolution layers. Then created two CNNs, one with two convolution layers and the other with one. Compared the models' learning curves to evaluate how they learned over time and compared each model's accuracy. The best model was able to achieve 99% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.
